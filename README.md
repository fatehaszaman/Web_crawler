### Java/Python crawl tooling for IEEE ICDCS 2020 website-fingerprinting research

This repository contains the URL-collection tooling I built for a university Network Privacy Lab. It fed the deep-learning website-fingerprinting pipeline whose results were published at IEEE ICDCS 2020. The job of this code is narrow but load-bearing: produce large, clean, domain-scoped URL sets that downstream packet-capture and CNN/LSTM training stages can consume without manual cleanup.

## Information Systems & Scalability

* **Bulk URL acquisition.** `WebCrawler.java` is a BFS crawler that ingests up to a configurable cap (run at 50,000 URLs per invocation) using a `Queue` of frontier URLs plus a `HashSet` of visited URLs to prevent revisits and unbounded growth.
* **Domain scoping and content filtering.** The crawler enforces a strict `https://www.nytimes.com/` prefix check and a configurable exclusion list (section keywords, topic paths, Wirecutter links) so that downstream training data stays on-distribution and free of low-value sections (interactives, crosswords, opinion tags, etc.).
* **Deduplication discipline at every stage.** `URLScraper.java`, `UniqueLinks.java`, and `PrintLinksInAlphabeticalOrder.java` all apply `HashSet` deduplication and pattern-based validation (`^https://www\.nytimes\.com/\d{4}/\d{2}/\d{2}/[a-z\-]+\.html$`) before any URL is allowed into the dataset. This is what keeps the eventual trace dataset clean without a separate cleanup pass.
* **Sampling vs. exhaustive modes.** Two collection strategies are supported: BFS traversal (`WebCrawler.java`) for broad coverage from a seed URL, and homepage random-sampling (`URLScraper.java`, capped at 1,000 unique article URLs per run) for distributional balance. Combining the two is what produced the ~300k-URL corpus used by the lab.

## SDLC & Engineering Discipline

* **Versioned iteration of the collection logic.** `Web-Crawler-Trial-1.py` through `Web-Crawler-Trial-4.py` preserve the Python prototype generations (Wikipedia random pages, USA Today, BBC, BBC-with-dedup) that fed into the final Java implementation. Keeping these in-repo makes the design decisions auditable rather than folkloric.
* **Small, single-purpose tools.** Each file does one job (crawl, sample, generate, dedupe, sort). Composition happens via files on disk, which kept the lab pipeline debuggable when a single stage misbehaved.
* **Reproducibility primitives.** Seed URL, max-URL cap, and Wirecutter-exclusion flag are explicit parameters on `WebCrawler.crawl(...)`, so every dataset run can be reproduced from three values.

## Impact

The output of this tooling was the input to the lab's packet-capture and traffic-trace pipeline, which trained CNN/LSTM models published at **IEEE ICDCS 2020**. Reworking the crawl logic produced roughly a 60% improvement in output volume, validity, and run time over the prior approach the lab had been using.

## How to Run

Requirements: JDK 8+ for the Java crawlers; Python 3.8+ with `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `lxml` for the prototypes.

**Java — main crawler:**

```bash
javac WebCrawler.java
java WebCrawler
```

To change the seed URL, max URL cap, or Wirecutter exclusion, edit the constants in `main(...)` at the bottom of `WebCrawler.java`. Output is printed to stdout one URL per line, so the usual pattern is to redirect: `java WebCrawler > links.txt`.

**Java — homepage sampler:**

```bash
javac URLScraper.java && java URLScraper > sampled.txt
```

**Java — post-processing:**

```bash
javac UniqueLinks.java && java UniqueLinks                 # reads ./Links.txt
javac PrintLinksInAlphabeticalOrder.java                   # edit filePath in source first
java PrintLinksInAlphabeticalOrder
```

**Python prototypes:**

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
python Web-Crawler-Trial-1.py
```

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `WebCrawler.java` | BFS crawler with visited-set, domain filter, and exclusion-list. Primary tool. |
| `URLScraper.java` | Homepage random-sampler; collects up to 1,000 unique article URLs matching the NYT date/section pattern. |
| `NYTimesURLGenerator.java` | Probes URL patterns by HTTP response code to surface valid endpoints. |
| `PrintLinksInAlphabeticalOrder.java` | Post-processor: extracts `href` targets from a file, sorts, reports count. |
| `UniqueLinks.java` | Deduplication pass over raw link output; filters to valid NYT `.html` URLs. |
| `Web-Crawler-Trial-1..4.py` | Python prototypes preserved for design provenance. |

## Stack

Java (`java.net.URL`, `java.util.regex`, BFS over `Queue`/`HashSet`), Python (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `lxml`), regex-based HTML parsing.

## Roadmap / Future Hardening

The version in this repo is the research artifact as-shipped — single-process, single-threaded, with `e.printStackTrace()` as the error path. The natural next step toward a production-grade ingestion service, and the direction I'd take it next, is:

* Concurrent fetching via a thread pool or an async client (Java `HttpClient` with `CompletableFuture`, or Python `asyncio` + `aiohttp`) to saturate I/O.
* A retry-with-exponential-backoff wrapper around fetch, distinguishing rate-limit (429), transient (5xx, timeouts), and permanent (404) failures.
* Structured persistence (Postgres or SQLite) replacing stdout/text-file handoff between stages, with a `(url, fetched_at, status, content_hash)` schema for resumability.
* A containerized run target (Dockerfile) plus a CI workflow that runs unit tests on the URL filter and dedup logic to prevent regressions on the parser.

These are intentionally not claimed as present in the current code — they are the IS-SDLC roadmap for hardening this research tooling into infrastructure.
